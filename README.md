# ComputerThermalPasteManager
This is my final project for school. 
The project aims to remind the user to replace the thermalpaste for each computer every two years.
The idea for this app came to me after I had periodic GPU failures and ended up changing it's thermalpaste.

# What did I use to make it?

Java, MySQL, Maven, Hibernate, JavaFX, Lombok

# How to use:

1. Use a program such as XAMPP to create a database named "myproject".
2. Go to hibernate.cfg.xml and HibernateUtil then change hbm2dll from update to create-drop.
3. After the table is created, switch the properties back to update.

# What does it do:

CRUD operations regarding computer revisions.
